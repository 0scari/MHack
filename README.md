# BikePie 
A JS software that allows to prepare a route with connected ends at any location you click on the Google Maps widget.
The software will also try to match the distance of the route to the one you specify.

The repo has two branches master: basic implementation; and: version2: more advanced algorithms, but not finalised yet.

### Possible Improvements
1. Save favorite directions
2. Run left to rigight or vice versa
3. Figure out how the streets are aligned
4. Street previews for the routes
